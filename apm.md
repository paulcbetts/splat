# Application Performance Monitoring

Application Performance Monitoring is split into the follow sections

* Error Reporting
* Feature Usage Tracking
* View Tracking

The table below shows the support across various APM packages

| Product | Maturity Level | Error Reporting | Feature Usage Tracking | View Tracking |
-------------
| Appcenter| Alpha | TODO | Native | Native |
| Application Insights | Alpha | TODO | Native | Native |
| Exceptionless | Alpha | TODO | Native | By Convention |
| New Relic | Not Started | TODO | TODO | TODO
| Raygun | Prototype | TODO | By Convention | By Convention |

## Goals of the Splat APM feature

* To sit on top of existing APM libaries using native features where possible, or by using a common convention that gives parity in behaviour.
** Where there is a convention behaviour it will be detailed under the relevant frameworks documentation.
* To define basic behaviours that are dropped into consuming libraries, for example with ReactiveUI
** Commands
** ViewModels
** Views

## Getting started with APM with Splat

Splat comes with a default implementation that pushes events into your active Splat logging framework. This allows for design and testing prior to hooking up a full APM offering.

## Configuring Appcenter

First configure Appcenter. For guidance see TODO

```cs
using Splat.AppCenter;

// then in your service locator initialisation
Locator.CurrentMutable.UseAppcenterApm();
```

## Configuring Application Insights

First configure Application Insights. For guidance see TODO

```cs
using Splat.ApplicationInsights;

// then in your service locator initialisation
Locator.CurrentMutable.UseApplicationInsightsApm();
```

## Configuring Exceptionless

First configure Exceptionless. For guidance see TODO

```cs
using Splat.Exceptionless;

// then in your service locator initialisation
Locator.CurrentMutable.UseExceptionlessApm();
```

## Configuring New Relic

New Relic support isn't currently available.

## Configuring Raygun

First configure Raygun. For guidance see TODO

```cs
using Splat.Raygun;

// then in your service locator initialisation
Locator.CurrentMutable.UseRaygunApm();
```

# Testing and developing the APM functionality

The unit tests for this functionality do not generate activity to the relevant platform.
The integration tests DO SEND TEST DATA to the relevant platforms, so they need to have
the user-secrets configured. There is a script in the \scripts\inttestusersecrets.cmd
that shows how to set the relevant secrets up.
